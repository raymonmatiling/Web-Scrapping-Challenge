# Web Scraping and Analysis 

## Background

You’re now ready to take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same core skills that you’ve been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.

## Data Source

1. [Mars News Website](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html)

2. [Mars Weather Facts Website](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html)

a. Automated browsing to visit the Mars news site and Extract Data

b. The titles and preview text of the news articles

c. The scraped information was stored in the specified Python data structure-specifically, a list of dictionaries.

d. Optional: [JSON file](https://github.com/raymonmatiling/Web-Scrapping-Challenge/blob/main/mars_news.json)

### 2. Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data.

a. HTML table extracted into a Pandas DataFrame

b. Answers to the following questions:

 - How many months exist on Mars? 12
 - How many Martian days' worth of data are there? 1977

c. Data and visualizations to answer the following questions:

 - Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest? Highest 8, lowest 3
 - Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest? Highest 9, lowest 6
 - How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? approximately 700.
